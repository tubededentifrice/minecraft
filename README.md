# Minecraft Clone Project

A high-performance, browser-based Minecraft clone using Three.js for the frontend and Rust for the backend server.

## Project Overview

This project aims to create a faithful Minecraft-like experience in the browser with the following key features:

- **Voxel-based 3D world** with procedural generation
- **Multiplayer support** for real-time collaboration and interaction
- **High-performance rendering** using Three.js and WebGL
- **Scalable backend** implemented in Rust for optimal performance
- **Modern networking** with WebSockets and binary protocols

The game supports core Minecraft gameplay elements including block manipulation, crafting, survival mechanics, and more, while being optimized for browser environments.

## Documentation

This repository includes comprehensive documentation to guide development:

- [Original Specifications](./SPECS.md) - The initial project requirements
- [Enhanced Specifications](./ENHANCED_SPECS.md) - Detailed implementation considerations
- [TODO List](./TODO.md) - Comprehensive task breakdown

- [Development Roadmap](./ROADMAP.md) - Phased implementation plan with milestones

## Architecture Overview

### Frontend (Three.js)

The frontend is built with Three.js and TypeScript, providing:

- Efficient chunk-based rendering with greedy meshing
- Client-side prediction for responsive gameplay
- Advanced graphics features including custom shaders
- Responsive UI for in-game interactions and menus
- Optimized asset loading and management

### Backend (Rust)

The backend server is implemented in Rust for maximum performance:

- Asynchronous architecture using Tokio
- WebSocket communication with binary protocol
- Entity Component System (ECS) for game logic
- Efficient world generation and persistence
- Scalable design for handling many concurrent players

### Networking

The client-server communication uses:

- WebSockets for real-time bidirectional communication
- Binary protocol with MessagePack or Protocol Buffers
- Client-side prediction with server reconciliation
- Optimized chunk streaming and entity updates
- Secure authentication and session management

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

For development, you'll need:

- Node.js 18+ for frontend development
- Rust 1.67+ for backend development
- Docker and Docker Compose for local environment
- Git for version control

### Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/minecraft-clone.git
   cd minecraft-clone
   ```

2. Set up the frontend:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Set up the backend:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   cargo build
   cargo run
   ```

4. Alternatively, use Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

5. Access the development server at http://localhost:3000

## Development Workflow

See the [Development Roadmap](./ROADMAP.md) for the phased implementation plan and [TODO List](./TODO.md) for specific tasks.

## Project Structure

The recommended project structure is detailed in [Project Structure](./PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md).
